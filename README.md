## Data Overview

The analysis is based on two primary datasets:
- **Social Media Data:**  
  Contains annual metrics of social media user growth, including user counts and engagement statistics.
- **Suicide Rates Data:**  
  Comprises yearly suicide rate statistics, segmented by relevant demographics and regions.

Data from these sources were merged and cleaned to ensure consistency and reliability for subsequent analysis.
